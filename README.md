# Title: Fine-Tuning LaMDA 3 for Climate Science Question Answering

# Description:

This repository contains the code for fine-tuning the LaMDA 3 model (from https://huggingface.co/unsloth/llama-3-8b-bnb-4bit) on climate science questions. The model is trained to answer user queries in a comprehensive and informative way.

# Project Structure:

- Fine_Tuning_LLama3_for_Climate_Science_Questions.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing the fine-tuning code.
requirements.txt: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the code.
- lora_model (optional): If you've saved the fine-tuned model, it will be stored here.

# Dependencies:

The code relies on the following Python libraries. Make sure you have them installed before running the notebook:

Bash
torch
huggingface_hub
ipython
unsloth[colab] @ git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git
datasets


Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Running the code

# 1. Clone this repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fine-tuning-llama3-climate-science.git
cd fine-tuning-llama3-climate-science

# 2. Install dependencies:

Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


# 3. Open the Jupyter Notebook environment in your preferred way (e.g., using a Jupyter Notebook server or Colab).
 - Open the Fine_Tuning_LLama3_for_Climate_Science_Questions.ipynb file.
 - Execute the code cells sequentially.
 - Explanation of the Code:

# 4. Imports and Configurations:
Imports necessary libraries like FastLanguageModel from unsloth, torch, SFTTrainer from trl, and TrainingArguments from transformers.
Sets max_seq_length (maximum sequence length for inputs) and loads the climate_fever dataset (split: "test").
# Load Llama-3 8b Model:
Loads the pre-trained LaMDA 3 model (from the provided Hugging Face Hub URL) with FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained. Sets max_seq_length and enables 4-bit quantization with load_in_4bit=True.
# Before Training:
Defines a function generate_text that takes input text, tokenizes it, generates text using the model, and decodes the generated tokens back to text.
Prints "Before training" and uses generate_text to demonstrate the model's initial output for a sample question about deforestation's impact on global warming.
# Model Patching and Training (Commented Out):
The commented section includes code for patching the model with Fast LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) weights (model.get_peft_model). This step is optional and can provide improved performance. You can experiment with enabling it and adjusting hyperparameters like r, target_modules, etc. if needed.
# Training:
Creates an SFTTrainer instance, specifying the model, training dataset, tokenizer, and training arguments.
Trains the model using the trainer.train() method.
# After Training:
Prints "After training".
Uses generate_text to demonstrate the model's output for the same sample question after fine-tuning.
# Saving the Model (Optional):
The commented line model.save_pretrained("lora_model") saves the fine-tuned model (if Fast LoRA was used). You can uncomment this line to save the model for future use.

# Important Notes:

- Training a large model like LaMDA 3 requires significant computational resources. Running the code on your local machine might be impractical. Consider using a cloud platform with GPUs for training.
- The provided code uses a sample dataset (climate_fever, "test" split). You might need to adjust the code and dataset based on your specific use case and data availability.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters like batch size, learning rate
